The <strong>MNIST database</strong>, short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau.

Also, this way, will get to compare how conventional neural networks compare to convolutional neural networks, that we will build in the next module.
