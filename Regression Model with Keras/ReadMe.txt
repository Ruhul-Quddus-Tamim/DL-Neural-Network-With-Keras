Despite the popularity of more powerful libraries such as PyToch and TensorFlow, they are not easy to use and have a steep learning curve. 
So, for people who are just starting to learn deep learning, there is no better library to use other than the Keras library.
Keras is a high-level API for building deep learning models. It has gained favor for its ease of use and syntactic simplicity facilitating fast development. 
As you will see in this lab and the other labs in this repository, building a very complex deep learning network can be achieved with Keras with only few lines of code.
You will appreciate Keras even more, once you learn how to build deep models using PyTorch and TensorFlow in the other courses.
